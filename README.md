# Better LS

### Inspired by

- [colorls](https://github.com/athityakumar/colorls), as I've been using it for quite a while.
- [ls](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html) as expected to support the same commands as the unix LS.
- my desire to learn [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).
